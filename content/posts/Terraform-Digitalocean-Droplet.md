A quick terraform guide for setting up droplet with user-data in digitalocean.

User-data is arbitrary data that a user can supply to a Droplet during its creation time. User-data can be consumed by CloudInit, typically during the first boot of a cloud server, to perform tasks or run scripts as the root userâ€“this can be extremely useful when provisioning a server.


## Quickstart

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tankibaj/Digitalocean-Terraform-Droplet.git

  ```

- Prepare your working directory for other commands

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- Create infrastructure

  ```bash
